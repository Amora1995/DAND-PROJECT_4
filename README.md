# DAND-PROJECT_4

Wrangle &amp; Analyze the WeRateDogs Twitter Archive.

The "We Rate Dogs" Twitter archive contains over 5000 tweets, which have been filtered to create the enhanced archive that forms the basis of this analysis. The goal of this project is to wrangle the data - gather, assess, and clean - into a tidy dataset, and then provide analyses and visualizations.
